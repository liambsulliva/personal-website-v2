# Portfolio Page

This project is a portfolio page built with Astro. It serves as a personal showcase of photography work, fetching and displaying photos from a Flickr account. The page is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, allowing visitors to easily navigate through the portfolio.

The portfolio page uses the Flickr API to fetch the photos. It requires a Flickr API key and a user ID, which are set as environment variables. The page also includes a back button for easy navigation and a footer with additional information.

## Environment Variables

The project uses the following environment variables:

- `FLICKR_API_KEY`: The API key for the Flickr API.
- `FLICKR_USER_ID`: The user ID of the Flickr account.

Be sure to replace these with your own personal keys while building.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
