          Kingdra Pokemon Teambuilder is a full-stack web application I built to
          solve a problem I encountered while organizing a Pokemon draft league
          for my friends. What started as a simple tool for managing draft teams
          evolved into a comprehensive teambuilder that bridges the gap between
          casual and competitive Pokemon team creation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The project addresses a critical gap in the Pokemon teambuilder
          market: most existing tools have poor UIs and lack the ability to set
          moves and stats unless you're using Pokemon Showdown. Additionally,
          there's a lack of tools that can create both casual and competitive
          teams in the same place. This application adapts to user preferences,
          allowing seamless switching between game modes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and a modern tech stack, the
          application features infinite scrolling, real-time stat calculations,
          user authentication, team management, and full import/export
          capabilities with Pokemon Showdown.

        The project began in June 2024 as a learning exercise. I wanted to
        master{" "}
        <a
          class="text-link"
          href="https://nextjs.org/"

        >
          Next.js
        </a>{" "}
        and build my first real full-stack application. The initial goal was simple:
        create a tool for managing teams in a Pokemon draft league (think fantasy
        football, but with Pokemon).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, as I started building, I realized that existing Pokemon
        teambuilders had significant limitations. Most had terrible UIs, and few
        allowed you to actually set moves and stats unless you were using{" "}
        <a
          class="text-link"
          href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/"

          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Pokemon Showdown
        </a>
        . More importantly, there was no tool that could seamlessly handle both casual
        and competitive team building in the same interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This realization transformed the project from a simple draft tool into a
        comprehensive teambuilder. I spent countless hours implementing the core
        logic, including stat calculations that{" "}
        <a
          class="text-link"
          href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stat#Determination_of_stats"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          mimic the exact math
        </a>{" "}
        used in the core Pokemon games, integrating with external APIs for Pokemon
        data, and building a robust database schema for team management.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The tech stack includes Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend,
        MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage, GraphQL with Apollo Client for
        API management, and Clerk for authentication. Key features include
        infinite scrolling with tabbing systems, real-time stat calculations,
        Smogon data integration, type matchup analysis, and full Pokemon
        Showdown import/export compatibility.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Several challenges emerged during development. Using{" "}

          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Flowbite
        </a>{" "}
        saved initial development time but locked me into an inflexible ecosystem,
        requiring creative CSS solutions for mobile adaptation. External Pokemon
        APIs have limitations that required careful data handling. Managing infinite
        scroll with 1000+ Pokemon required debounced search, efficient state management,
        and strategic caching for smooth performance.

        Building the Kingdra Pokemon Teambuilder has been an incredible learning
        experience. What started as a simple draft league tool evolved into a
        comprehensive full-stack application that addresses real gaps in the
        Pokemon teambuilder market.

            <strong>Full-Stack Mastery:</strong> This project taught me the entire
            development lifecycle, from database design with MongoDB to GraphQL API
            creation, React state management, and deployment. Working with Clerk
            for authentication and Apollo Client for data fetching gave me hands-on
            experience with modern development tools.

            <strong>Mobile-First Lessons:</strong> The mobile adaptation phase revealed
            the importance of considering all device types from the start. Converting
            a desktop-optimized UI to mobile required rethinking navigation, information
            hierarchy, and interaction patterns. The PWA implementation significantly
            improved the mobile experience.

            <strong>Component Library Trade-offs:</strong> While Flowbite accelerated
            initial development, its constraints became apparent during mobile adaptation.
            This highlighted the importance of evaluating long-term flexibility when
            choosing dependencies.

          <p>
            <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Managing infinite scroll with
            1000+ Pokemon, implementing debounced search, and optimizing GraphQL
            queries taught me valuable lessons about performance optimization in
            React applications.

          <p>
            Replacing Flowbite components with custom, device-agnostic solutions
            to improve flexibility and maintainability
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Enhanced filtering options by types, stats, and moves for better
            user experience on mobile devices
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Moving search to the backend for more sophisticated filtering and
            better performance as the Pokemon database grows
