          This case study explores the development of an interactive digital
          book for the Human Engineering Research Labs (HERL). The project aimed
          to transform their physical historical booklet into an engaging web
          experience, focusing on creating a performant and visually appealing
          presentation that maintains the familiar book metaphor.

    <section id="context">
      <h3 class="!mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Context</h3>
      <p>
        The project began with a clear directive: create a digital version of
        HERL's historical booklet that would be embedded within their website.
        Rather than converting the content into a traditional webpage format, I
        chose to preserve and enhance the book metaphor, creating an interactive
        3D experience that would feel familiar to users while taking advantage
        of web technologies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The decision to use Svelte was driven by the project's specific
        constraints. The final product needed to be embedded in an iframe on
        HERL's website, which meant performance was crucial. Svelte's
        compilation to vanilla JavaScript, without the overhead of a virtual
        DOM, made it an ideal choice for this use case.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Several key challenges emerged during development. Initial attempts with
        Three.js and Threlte proved too complex for the book interface, so I
        pivoted to CSS 3D transforms which offered a simpler, more performant
        solution. The iframe integration introduced strict limitations on
        content presentation and scrolling behavior, demanding creative
        solutions for content display. The host website's existing overhead
        required careful optimization, influencing the choice of Svelte and
        leading to the implementation of strategic content loading patterns.

      <p>
        The navigation system evolved significantly throughout development,
        ultimately landing on a bookmark-based approach for quick access to key
        years (1995, 1996, 2001, 2004, 2011, and 2023). The bookmarks are
        positioned vertically along the right edge of the book and work in both
        open and closed states. I also added intuitive controls including arrow
        key navigation and page numbers for easier tracking of position within
        the book.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The project underwent several key adaptations to optimize performance
        and user experience. I implemented delayed content loading and image
        preloading that fetches content 5 pages ahead, creating seamless
        transitions between pages while preventing browser overwhelm. I shifted
        from a responsive design to fixed dimensions (1000 x 750 pixels) to
        ensure consistent presentation within the iframe, with strategic
        downsizing at specific breakpoints for smaller screens.

        Developing HERL Through The Years revealed valuable insights about
        creating engaging digital narratives while working within technical
        constraints.

            <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> The shift from Three.js to
            CSS 3D transforms, coupled with strategic content loading, proved crucial
            for maintaining smooth animations while handling extensive historical
            content.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Navigation Evolution:</strong> The bookmark system emerged as
            an elegant solution to balance quick access to key moments with the book
            metaphor, enhancing usability without sacrificing the visual design.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Fixed vs. Responsive:</strong> The decision to optimize for fixed
            dimensions, while initially challenging, ultimately led to a more polished
            and reliable presentation within the iframe context.

        <li>
          <p>
            Implement offline caching capabilities to improve load times and

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider creating a standalone version that could serve as a
            template for other historical documentation projects
