        <p>
          Kingdra Pokemon Teambuilder is a full-stack web application I built to
          solve a problem I encountered while organizing a Pokemon draft league
          for my friends. What started as a simple tool for managing draft teams
          evolved into a comprehensive teambuilder that bridges the gap between
          casual and competitive Pokemon team creation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The project addresses a critical gap in the Pokemon teambuilder
          market: most existing tools have poor UIs and lack the ability to set
          moves and stats unless you're using Pokemon Showdown. Additionally,
          there's a lack of tools that can create both casual and competitive
          teams in the same place. This application adapts to user preferences,
          allowing seamless switching between game modes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and a modern tech stack, the
          application features infinite scrolling, real-time stat calculations,
          user authentication, team management, and full import/export
          capabilities with Pokemon Showdown.
        </p>

    <section id="context">
      <h3 class="!mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Context</h3>
      <p>
        The project began in June 2024 as a learning exercise. I wanted to
        master <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Next.js
        </a> and build my first real full-stack application. The initial goal was
        simple: create a tool for managing teams in a Pokemon draft league (think
        fantasy football, but with Pokemon).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, as I started building, I realized that existing Pokemon
        teambuilders had significant limitations. Most had terrible UIs, and few
        allowed you to actually set moves and stats unless you were using <a
          href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          Pokemon Showdown
        </a>. More importantly, there was no tool that could seamlessly handle
        both casual and competitive team building in the same interface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The tech stack includes Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend,
        MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage, GraphQL with Apollo Client for
        API management, and Clerk for authentication. Key features include
        infinite scrolling with tabbing systems, real-time stat calculations,
        Smogon data integration, type matchup analysis, and full Pokemon
        Showdown import/export compatibility.
      </p>

      <h3 class="!mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Development</h3>
      <p>
        This realization transformed the project from a simple draft tool into a
        comprehensive teambuilder. I spent countless hours implementing the core
        logic, including stat calculations that <a
          href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stat#Determination_of_stats"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          mimic the exact math
        </a> used in the core Pokemon games, integrating with external APIs for Pokemon
        data, and building a robust database schema for team management.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The stat calculation system implements the exact formulas used in the
        Pokemon games:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`// Add stat calculation code here`}
        language="typescript"

        Several key challenges emerged during development that required creative
        solutions:

          <p>
            External Pokemon APIs have limitations that required careful data
            handling. Managing infinite scroll with 1000+ Pokemon required
            debounced search, efficient state management, and strategic caching
            for smooth performance.

          <h4 class="text-xl font-medium text-white">Mobile Optimization</h4>
          <p>
            The mobile adaptation phase revealed the importance of considering
            all device types from the start. Converting a desktop-optimized UI
            to mobile required rethinking navigation, information hierarchy, and
            interaction patterns. The PWA implementation significantly improved
            the mobile experience.

      <p>
        The Pokemon Showdown import/export system allows seamless transfer of
        teams:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`// Add import/export code here`}
        language="typescript"
      />
      <p>
        Future enhancements include replacing Flowbite components with custom,
        device-agnostic solutions, enhanced filtering options by types, stats,
        and moves, and moving search to the backend for more sophisticated
        filtering as the Pokemon database grows.
