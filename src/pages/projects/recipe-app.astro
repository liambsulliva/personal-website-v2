          The Sullivan Family Recipe App is a digital cookbook that preserves
          and shares classic family recipes passed down through generations.
          Built with Astro, the site combines dynamic rendering with static
          generation to create a fast, accessible recipe browsing experience.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The project focuses on creating an intuitive interface for discovering
          recipes while maintaining the personal touch of handwritten recipe
          cards. Each recipe is written in Markdown and statically generated for
          optimal performance.

    <section id="context">
      <h3 class="!mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Context</h3>
      <p>
        The idea for this project came from wanting to digitize my family's
        collection of recipes that had been accumulated over decades. Many of
        these recipes existed only on worn recipe cards or in handwritten notes,
        at risk of being lost or damaged over time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I chose Astro as the framework for its unique approach to static site
        generation. The landing page is dynamically rendered to showcase
        featured recipes and categories, while individual recipe pages are
        statically generated from Markdown files at build time. This hybrid
        approach provides the best of both worlds: dynamic content organization
        with the performance benefits of static HTML.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Markdown format made it easy to write and edit recipes with a
        simple, readable syntax. Each recipe file includes frontmatter for
        metadata like preparation time, servings, and difficulty, while the
        recipe instructions are written in plain Markdown, making them easy to
        update and maintain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        React components handle interactive elements like the recipe search and
        filtering system, while Tailwind provides a clean, responsive design
        that works beautifully on devices from phones to desktops.

        Building the Sullivan Family Recipe App was an excellent opportunity to
        explore Astro's capabilities while creating something meaningful for my
        family. The project successfully achieved its goals of preserving
        recipes and making them easily accessible.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Markdown as a Content Format:</strong> Using Markdown for recipes
            proved to be an excellent choice. It's human-readable, version-controllable,
            and easy for non-technical family members to edit once they understand
            the basic syntax.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Static Generation Benefits:</strong> The static generation approach
            means the site loads instantly and requires minimal server resources.
            Recipe pages are generated once at build time and served as static HTML,
            resulting in excellent performance and SEO.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Hybrid Rendering:</strong> Astro's ability to combine dynamic
            rendering on the landing page with static generation for recipe pages
            provided the perfect balance of flexibility and performance for this
            use case.

      <p><strong>Future Enhancements</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add a recipe submission form that generates pull requests with new
            Markdown files, allowing family members to contribute recipes
            without touching code
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Implement a measurement converter for switching between imperial and
            metric units
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add print-friendly styling optimized for recipe cards</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a meal planning feature to help organize weekly menus using
            the available recipes
