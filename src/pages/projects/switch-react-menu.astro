          This Nintendo Switch App Launcher is a minimalist implementation of a
          traditional home menu. It relies on the JavaScript library <a
            href="https://github.com/TooTallNate/nx.js"
            target="_blank">nx.js</a
          >, built by <a href="https://github.com/TooTallNate" target="_blank"
            >TooTallNate</a
          >, to render React components to a generic canvas element through the <a
            href="https://github.com/TooTallNate/react-tela"
            target="_blank">react-tela</a
          > library.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While the react-tela framework itself is runtime-agnostic, it was the
          only way I could find to run the JSX runtime on the Nintendo Switch.
          Even though this interface relies on minimal reactivity, I thought the
          concept of running a React app on a console was interesting enough to
          be worth exploring.

      <p>
        In the Winter of 2024, I found myself with a full break from school for
        the holidays and a lot of time to kill. It made sense to start working
        on something new that I could show off, while also keeping the scope
        small enough that I could realistically finish the thing by the end of
        the break.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I had already been pretty invested in the world of Nintendo <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)"
          target="_blank">homebrew</a
        > by this point. I had custom firmware running on not just my switch, but
        pretty much every Nintendo console I owned (Wii, DSI, 3DS, and Wii U). So
        I really liked the idea of taking a stab at building an app for a Nintendo
        console. However, I found the typical options to be a little lacking. Working
        with C/C++ seemed like it would be too much of a pain to get started, and
        I didn't want to spend too much time tinkering with the low-level details
        of the console's APIs in order to build a simple app.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While JavaScript may not be an obvious choice, it's actually relatively
        fast compared to other high level options like Python, and its frontend
        ecosystem plays well with UI development.

            The framework gave me shockingly low-level access to the hardware.

          <p>
            React's declarative UI feels like a natural fit for a quick and
            dirty app like this. Reacting to state changes felt far more natural
            to work with than manually updating the UI, especially when it came
            to handling controller input.

    <section id="development">
      <h3 class="!mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold text-white">Development</h3>
      <p>
        The development process was a bit of a rollercoaster. I started out by
        trying to use the Canvas API directly, but it was a bit of a pain to
        work with. I ended up using the react-tela library to render the React
        components to a canvas, which was a lot easier to work with.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I also had to become familiar with the <a
          href="https://nxjs.n8.io/runtime/concepts/applications"
          target="_blank">Switch.Application API</a
        >. It reads the switch's app titles, authors, and box art from the
        Switch's app catalog. It can be used to iterate over the app catalog and
        sort for box art like this:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`const switchApps = Array.from(Switch.Application).filter(
  (app) => app.icon
);`}
        language="javascript"
      />
      <p>
        When fetched, images are stored as <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap"
          target="_blank">bitmap files</a
        > in order to render them to the canvas. If images can't be fetched, the
        loop continues to the next app.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`for (const app of switchApps) {
  let img;
  if (app.icon) {
    img = await createImageBitmap(new Blob([app.icon]));
  }
  if (!img) continue;
  //...
}`}
        language="javascript"
      />
      <p>
        Each image renders exactly 40 pixels away from each other so that the
        grid can fit exactly 4 apps across the Switch's 1280 pixel width screen.
        It offers future proofing in case Nintendo decides to release a new
        model with a different screen size at some point in the future (though I
        highly doubt it, given the existence of the <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch_2"
          target="_blank">Switch 2</a
        >)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Controller inputs are handled by a custom <a
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_hooks.asp"
          target="_blank">hook</a
        > that listens for button presses and updates the UI accordingly. It listens
        for both left and right directional inputs on the stick and D-pad, as well
        as detecting shoulder buttons to quickly swap pages. It also listens for
        the A button to launch whatever app is selected.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since drawing borders around images isn't directly supported by the
        Canvas API, I had to use a bit of a tricky workaround. I drew a slightly
        larger Rectangle object directly behind the image to create the border.
        It uses a 5-pixel white stroke to create the border effect whenever
        React detects that the image is selected.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        code={`{displayedApp.app.icon && (
  <>
    {isSelected && (
      <Rect
        x={displayedApp.x - 5}
        y={displayedApp.y - 5}
        width={displayedApp.width + 10}
        height={displayedApp.height + 10}
        fill="none"
        stroke="white" // Draws the border
        lineWidth={5} // 5-pixel width
      />
      //...
)}
`}
        language="javascript"
      />
      <p>
        While the current implementation provides a solid foundation for
        browsing and launching apps, there's still plenty of room for growth.
        Features like filtering apps by name or developer, photo album support,
        and other improvements would make the experience feel more complete.
        These aren't too complicated to implement, and the React-forward
        architecture will make it pretty straightforward to add these things in
        the future if time permits.
